Raspberry Pi Direct Hardware Access
===================================

This is a light-weight library for easy access to the Raspberry Pi's
integrated peripherals.  It can be used from user mode as well as from kernel
mode, and it works fine from a real-time context of one of the real-time
Linux patches like Xenomai.  It even works when doing bare-metal programming.

For more Information, generate documentation using "make doc", this needs
doxygen.  An on-line copy is available at http://offis.github.io/raspi-directhw/
